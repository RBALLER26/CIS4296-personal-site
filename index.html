                system. This project had been started during the Spring 2022 Semester and was planned to conclude in December 2022. The project had included developing a new support desk tracking system which the DEC
                will be able to utilize to track their assets that they have supplied to nearby communities. The DEC's goal is to supply low-income / technologically inadequate homes with 
                reliable access to internet through the use of donated laptops. The end-users may find issues with their laptops as they have not used laptops extensively prior to this which 
                is why the DEC finds it imperative to incorporate a new support desk tracking system so that the end-users can find adequate help for their assets. The project is ongoing and only within the initial planning stages currently
                , as it develops the updates will be posted here.</p>

                and had involved us creating a board game of any sort. The project had been a partner project and for this project I had Aamir Contractor as my partner. The game was written entirely in C# and utilized the ASP.NET environment we were taught within the course.
                This was one of the more challenging projects I had tackled as it had involved the entire start to finish of creating an extensive program. This process had included creating multiple UML diagrams, including UML Use Case Diagrams, Swim Lane Diagrams and various other diagrams.
                The project in its finality would allow you to play the original battleship board game against a CPU player in which you would select cells to put the ship and then the CPU would randomly fire. The game would continue back and forth until one player
                had all of their ships destroyed. </p>

                their sister company CORL. As an ITRM Intern I generally work in a client-faced environment where the clients are the various medical companies that Meditology works with. I generally just aid in the the various project management tasks such as creating meeting minutes, meeting agendas
                and executive summaries as I have only started earlier this year. My current assignments involve me attending Client Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Interviews where we gather evidence and documentation from the clients on various security domains to ensure that their security systems are up to code across a variety of domains.

            <p class="text-justify"> 
                Another Internship which I had during Summer of 2021 was as a IT Help Desk Intern for Iovance Biotherapeutics where I had been working remotely while the company was based in San Carlos, CA. The company was working on TIL Therapy which was a form of Cancer therapy and would essentially be a cure for certain types of cancer.
                This experience had peaked my interest as prior to being an IST Major I had been a Pre-Medical Major and had shadowed at the Oncology Department at Jefferson Hospital of Torresdale. I figured this position would be ideal for me as it had combined both Tech and the medical industry. The position was a great introductory Internship experience 
                as it had introduced me to the industry as well as had taught basic industry and employment practices. The majority of the internship had been filled with busy work and lots of downtime but this was expected as it was my first real internship and I had little to no techncial experience. Typically the workload had involved me shadowing 
                various members of the IT Support Team as they helped solve IT tickets for the company or I had handled some small tickets myself as well as aided in projects here and there such as the LDAP integration of Zendesk and EZOfficeInventory which had merged both the ticketing system and the asset management system into one environment which was constantly
                updated. Overall the experience and connections I had made at Iovance were memorable and a great start to my career.
